# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# MagNews

Mag news is an application that allows the user to see the latest news of the moment.

# Technologies

It uses Javascript and React to make the pages more dynamic and responsive with the news it receives from the API, also using Bootstrap to style in a more practical way.

# Instructions

To work, you need to create an account on the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) website, where you will receive your API KEY, and paste it into the .env file

Example: VITE_API_KEY=K7R9E2F5L1T3N8A6I4Q
